# AERO_Console
This program is a graphical user interface for Mark Drela's AVL and XFoil. It is originally developed by Dr. Rahimi to help students in the Aerodynamics and Performance course (MECH-4671) at the University of Windsor. 

## Background
Since AVL and XFoil are very useful, free, and powerful tools, they were chose for the teaching purposes in the course. However, the user interface is rather outdated and many students had issues working with the DOS command window. Therefore, I tried to aleviate this pain by developing a graphical user interface that helps mostly with the design process for the AVL and has other functionalities as well.

## How to Install
