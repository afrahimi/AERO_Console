# AERO_Console
This program is a graphical user interface for Mark Drela's AVL and XFoil. It is originally developed by Dr. Rahimi to help students in the Aerodynamics and Performance course (MECH-4671) at the University of Windsor. 

## Background
Since AVL and XFoil are very useful, free, and powerful tools, they were chose for the teaching purposes in the course. However, the user interface is rather outdated and many students had issues working with the DOS command window. Therefore, I tried to aleviate this pain by developing a graphical user interface that helps mostly with the design process for the AVL and has other functionalities as well.

## How to Install

> Note: This software is only compatiable with Windows OS. If you are
> using another OS, you can use the University's virtual machines or lab
> computers that run Windows to use this software.

You can download the latest version of the stand-alone program [from here](https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=69DFBF70939557A5&resid=69DFBF70939557A5!238401&authkey=AHrbgMu6AdSRKTc). After download:

 1. Make sure the file is in a folder that can read/write files to your computer storage without additional permissions.
 2. Open the .exe file and accept to run it if you get a message that it is not from a trusted publisher. It is because I am not a registered published with Microsoft and Windows.
 3. The program will unpack some required files to run locally in the same location as it is stored and will show the main window for you.
 4. You should see the following screen or a slightly different version of it.
